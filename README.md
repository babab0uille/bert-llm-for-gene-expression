# BERT-llm-for-Gene-Expression

This project demonstrates how a pre-trained large language model (LLM), BERT, can be used to predict gene expression levels from DNA sequences. By fine-tuning BERT for this specific biological task, the project showcases how LLMs can be applied to genomic data, providing valuable insights for biological research and medical applications.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure that the following packages are installed:

- `transformers` (for BERT)
- `torch` (for PyTorch)
- `datasets` (for dataset handling)
- `scikit-learn` (for evaluation metrics)
- `matplotlib` (for plotting)
- `pandas` (for data manipulation)

You can install these using pip:

```bash
!pip install transformers torch datasets scikit-learn matplotlib pandas
```

You can easily run this project on Google Colab or Jupyter Lab.
