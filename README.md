# bert-llm-for-gene-expression
Gene-Expression is a practice project where we use a pre-trained large language model (LLM), BERT, to predict gene expression levels from DNA sequences. We fine-tune BERT for this task, showing how LLMs can be applied to genomic data, helping to explore new possibilities in biological research and medicine.
